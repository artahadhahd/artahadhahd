C, C++, Rust, Python and a bit of JavaScript and Haskell

I use Python a lot for math problems and Django, JavaScript for NextJS, Rust for WGPU and making ~~terrible~~ CLI apps, C++ for compiler development and Vulkan, C and Haskell for fun.

I am learning Blender, and I am planning on making a renderer in Vulkan or WGPU.

Currently working on a C(++) "package manager"

I am a bit busy with school!
